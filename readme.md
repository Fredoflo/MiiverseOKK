# Miiverse World
A Miiverse clone experience created by PF2M that allows you to create posts, communities and more with your friends and followers. Not finished, and probably never will be.
## What is this?
It's a Miiverse clone, except you can make posts outside of communities and a feed system is implemented showing you the latest posts from people you follow and communities you've favorited. It also includes helpful pages like a user/community discovery helper, new features like tagging and private communities and the most complex search system of any Miiverse clone. However, it won't be fully finished by me, as I'm leaving all Miiverse clones and finding somewhere new to go. I only really put this up because I felt obligated to.
## To-do list
* Add community editing, with an interface for community banning and management
* Add audit logs, for both community admins and global admins
* Finish reporting; add it to comments, add a way to view them and add webhook support
* Finish blocking
* Add password resetting
* Add the ability to hide a user from recommendations
* Add post editing?
* Add messages?
